There are 6 to 8 newsgroups which provide girls, the most published are 
alt.binary.erotica, alt.binary.erotica.blonde, alt.binary.erocica.supermodel.
Most pictures are posted in several paragraphs, like judy.jpg(1/3),
judy.jpg(2/3), judy.jpg(3/3). That means the picture is coded in these three
files.( If there is something like judy.jpg(0/3), ignore it, it's just 
explanation). So you can save these files in your folder at one time by
picking the start file using left button and the end file using right button
of the mouse. Then you click the save box in the menu.

To decode it, there should be a command in your machine called "uudecode", you
can look it up by typing "man uudecode". If you don't have it, I can email you
this. But it can only decode a single formatted file, not the bunch of
unformatted files you saved. So I create a C program called v.c to do the 
whole thing, including deleting the original files after you decoded it.
To use it just type "v 5", then it decode the file 1-5, or you can type
"v 5 8", it'll decode the file 5-8. After that a judy.jpg will appear in your
directory, and you can enjoy it by "xv" or whatever graphics viewer you have
on your machine.

I'll email you the source file "v.c", then you can compile it on your machine
by typing" cc -o v v.c". If there is any problems, just tell me.
