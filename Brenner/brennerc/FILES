 These files are the C code used to call the Fortran library:
brenfort.h
brenfort.c

 These are files that provide examples of how to use the C interface to
the Fortran library:
brenffile.c
brenfras.c
g2c.sample.h

 Here are files used in building the C library (libbrenner.a). They are
largely ports of similar Fortran modules, except bren2.c, which John Michelsen
mostly wrote without following the Fortran code:
bcuint.c
bren2.c
caguts.c
ljguts.c
minimize.c
mtable.c
pibond.c
radic.c
sili_germ.c
brenc.h
vscale.c
calc_dist.h


 Here are files that show how to use the C library (libbrenner.a):
bren_file.c
bren_ras.c

 The following is code that John Michelsen was using to run the C version
under Hyperchem. It could probably be made to work with minor changes
(check the definition of CARBON), but Hyperchem doesn't seem to run
on an OS that I use.
Hc.h
Hcload.c
hc_bren.c
hsv.h
