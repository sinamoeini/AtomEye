Hello,

I'm a Ph.D student at the Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of
Systems (LAAS-CNRS, France). I'm developing a Kinetic Monte Carlo software
that simulates high-k oxides growth at the atomic scale (see
www.laas.fr/~gmazaley/ ).

I have used Rasmol and Molden but as soon as I found AtomEye, lots of my
problems disappeared, as my simulations usually take hundreds of thousands
of atoms (or even millions)... I would like to thank you for this very good
software.

The sun version was not so stable, thus I tried it on Linux systems (both
SuSE 8.2 and Mandrake 9.0) and it worked really fine.
But there is one problem: in France, we have 'AZERTY' keyboards (instead of
American 'QWERTY' for which AtomEye seems to be designed). Every function
works fine with a French keyboard except the 'Change Gear Box Value': I
can't change it.
On a French keyboard, numbers are considered as capital letters (we must
press MAJ or toggle 'CAPS LOCK') to write numbers. I think that's the reason
why AtomEye does not understand when I try to change gear box value...

Do you think there is a solution to this problem?

Anyway, thank you very much for AtomEye !

Best regards,
Guillaume MAZALEYRAT.
