Wei:

This is great news. It is now clear that there is no more mystery in
straight dislocations. All we need to do now for the Mo paper is to
change the wording, which I can do. I'll set up a notation system and
a text interpretation that we both agree, and I will present the
angular-dependent core energy for Mo - in which the constant part
contains atomistic info, and the angular-variable part depends on just
the elastic constant and angle=0 definition. You then need to check my
numbers for Mo, and reword the text until we both like it.

I will also put a toolkit of source codes and stand-alone linux
binaries on the web with documentation. They would allow for
displacement, strain, stress field predictions in addition to total
energy and total virial stress predictions in a PBC supercell.
