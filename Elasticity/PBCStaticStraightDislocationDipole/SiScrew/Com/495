Hi, Li Ju,
I finally did what you asked for.  The good news is that everything seem to 
fit together now.  The difference in core energy that we got (0.5022eV from 
you and 0.527eV/A from me) indeed seems to come from different convention 
(direction) of the core radius definition.

The simulation cell directions are: X-[112], Y-[111], Z-[110], and the 
dislocation dipole is along X axis.  I assume in your calculation, you must 
have defined the core radius as follows:  when the dislocation dipole are 
separated by rc (along X direction) their elastic energy is zero.

Unfortunately, I chose a different definition in my calculation (for 
mysterious reasons): when dislocation dipole are separated by rc (along Y 
direction) their elastic energy is zero.  I checked the energy difference 
in these two definitions, by computing the energy change when I rotate the 
dipole from X direction to Y direction, while keeping their separation rc 
constant.  The energy difference is 0.0486eV/A.  Dividing this by two, this 
will lead to a 0.0243eV/A difference in the resulting core energy.

I repeat the calculation using the two definitions, and get

(1)  rc defined along [112] direction:  Ecore = 0.5023 eV/A   (your data 
0.5023 eV/A)
(2)  rc defined along [111] direction:  Ecore = 0.5266 eV/A   (my earlier 
data 0.527eV/A)

The minute difference can be explained by the different elastic constants 
we have.  (I checked your web page, and find that somehow we are having 
slightly different elastic constants.)  But anyway, by now we have improved 
the agreement by one more order of magnitude.

Below are more details of the comparison.

Yes, I get the same atomistic energy (agreement within 2e-6eV)

My code only spit out the the image summation (Eimg) and the dipole energy 
(Eprm).  In both definitions above, Eimg=-3.243687372e-01eV/A.

With definition (1), Eprm=1.392634943eV/A.  Total elastic energy 
Eel=1.068266206eV/A.  Ecore=(Eatm-Eel)/2=0.5023eV/A 
(Eatm=15.921075/7.68052=2.0729eV/A).

With definition (2), 
Eprm=1.344021576eV/A.  Eel=1.019652839eV/A.  Ecore=(Eatm-Eel)=0.5266eV/A.

I agree.

Cheers!
